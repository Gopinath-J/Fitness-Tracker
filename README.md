# Fitness-Tracker
I just tried to use HTML and CSS fluently

I justm  created only a webpage...Not the database for this webpage

HTML: The structure includes a header with navigation, multiple sections (dashboard, workouts, nutrition, profile), and a footer. Each section has specific content and forms for tracking workouts and nutrition.

CSS: The styles define the layout, colors, and responsiveness using Grid and Flexbox. There are styles for cards, forms, and buttons, as well as media queries for responsiveness.

here is the sample images of the webpage
