# Fitness-Tracker
I just tried to use HTML and CSS fluently

I justm  created only a webpage...Not the database for this webpage

HTML: The structure includes a header with navigation, multiple sections (dashboard, workouts, nutrition, profile), and a footer. Each section has specific content and forms for tracking workouts and nutrition.

CSS: The styles define the layout, colors, and responsiveness using Grid and Flexbox. There are styles for cards, forms, and buttons, as well as media queries for responsiveness.
